### About the project: 

This Python project is a simple application that calculates fuel expenses during a trip based on the distance to be traveled and the vehicle's fuel consumption. The Calculation class is imported from a module called "calculation." Presumably, the "calculation" module contains the Calculation class, which is responsible for fuel-related calculations.

The main() function is defined as the entry point of the application. This function is called when the Python script is executed. A welcome message is displayed describing the purpose of the application, which is to calculate fuel expenses during a trip based on user-provided information. The list of available fuels for calculation is displayed on the screen: Alcohol, Diesel, and Gasoline. The application prompts the user to input the distance in kilometers to be traveled (distance) and the vehicle's fuel consumption in kilometers per liter (consumption).

Next, an instance of the Calculation class is created. The application calls the calculate_expense(distance, consumption) method of the Calculation class, passing the distance and consumption values as arguments. This method performs the calculations and returns a formatted string with estimated expenses for each type of fuel (Gasoline, Alcohol, and Diesel) based on the provided values and predefined prices for each fuel type. If the user enters a value that is not a valid number (for example, a string instead of a number), the code captures the ValueError exception and displays an error message. If the main() function is called directly (i.e., not as part of an import), it is executed to start the program. This is checked using the condition if __name__ == "__main__":. 

In summary, this is a simple application that calculates fuel expenses based on vehicle distance and consumption, allowing the user to choose from three types of fuel (Gasoline, Alcohol, and Diesel) and displaying the results on the screen.
